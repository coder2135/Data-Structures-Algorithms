## 💻 Data Structures & Algorithms – C++

Welcome to my DSA Journey in C++!

This repository is a curated collection of code, theory, and problem-solving patterns built with a founder's mindset — not just to crack interviews, but to deeply understand the fundamentals of computer science.

Whether you're a beginner trying to grasp recursion or someone trying to master dynamic programming, this repo is designed to document real growth through clean code, crisp notes, and strategic problem-solving.
